# Catch the Falling

Catch the Falling is a classic arcade-style game built using Python and the Pygame library. The objective of the game is to control a character at the bottom of the screen and catch the randomly falling objects before they hit the ground.

## Gameplay

The game starts with a player character represented by a black rectangle at the bottom of the screen. The player can move left and right using the arrow keys. As the game progresses, red rectangular objects start falling from the top of the screen at random positions. The player must position themselves under the falling objects to catch them.

Each successful catch increases the player's score by 1 point. The game continues indefinitely, and the player can keep playing to achieve a higher score.
